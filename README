There are three things here.
    1) elm327.js: node.js module to communicate with ELM327 IC. ELM327 is OBD <-> PC interface controller.
    2) elm-server.js: node.js app that serves information from ELM327 to client application
    3) elm-client.js: client code to communicate with elm-server.js

And test-app./js|html/ as an example application.
